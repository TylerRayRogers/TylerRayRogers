# Howdy! 👋 🤠
My name is Tyler Ray Rogers, a first-year Masters student in Economics :chart: from San Antonio, Texas!

More importantly, I'm a loud and proud member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣0️⃣ from Texas A&M University👍!

In my undergraduate career :mortar_board:, I was a double-major in Political Science 🏛️ and Economics 💹 and also had a minor in Business 💲. Despite all of that, I still graduated a semester early.

I come from a wonderful family 👪 with some fantastic parents who worked hard all their lives and enabled me to be the first in our family to obtain a college degree. I have a twin brother 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 and a younger sister 👱‍♀️ who is also a current student at A&M.

My interests are many and varied, but I especially enjoy reading 📚 (my favorite novels are "Lonesome Dove" and "Lord of the Rings"), board and card/domino games 🎲 (I'm pretty good at 42), and all Aggie sporting event, of course 🏈⚾.

I'm using GitHub as a real-time CV of sorts to showcase my coding and data experience to help strengthen my data scientists resume. Feel free to take a look at my profile to get an idea of what's going on! I'm currently primarily an R user, but I've also worked with SAS and Stata in the past. I'm also looking forward to learning new languages like Python to add to my repertoire.
